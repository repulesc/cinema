# Changelog

## 1.0.1 - first in-world test fixes
- Long-press opens the menu while the button is still held (`touch` event), not only on release.
- Chat commands on channel 9 (`/9 menu|start|stop|status|debug|far|maxcam|probe|reset`) so the HUD can be driven and diagnosed even if the menu does not open.
- `/9 status`: every script prints one line (state, permissions, memory).
- Director always prints first shot, ray errors and "no usable shot" (no longer hidden behind debug).
- Long shots (25-45 m) are opt-in (`/9 far on`) until the distance probe has been run.
- Test build defaults `debug` to on for fresh installs.

## 1.0.0 - first complete version
- `cinema_core.lsl`: permissions, controls, AFK detection (timer or SL "Away"), state machine
  (idle / engaging / rolling / paused / peek / no-shot / probe), instant bail-out on movement keys,
  HUD tap, typing and sit/stand; Alt-cam "peek"; mouselook + teleport pause/resume; in-world probes.
- `cinema_director.lsl`: scene scan, 10-ray environment survey, composition maths (thirds by camera
  height, level horizon, lead room), three archetypes (intimate, ensemble, vista incl. pillow shots),
  7-candidate raycast sweep with verification and a fallback ladder, editing grammar with four style
  presets, cooldown mode, optional speaker cut, director mode for manual sessions.
- `cinema_ui.lsl`: long-press dialog menu, protected Linkset Data settings, button states, first-run
  welcome + notecard, owner-change reset, script version check.
- Not included yet (phase 2): letterbox bars and dip-to-black overlay.
